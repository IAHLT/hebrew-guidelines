Not every annotation project starts from scratch, but this one does.
This means several things:
- Some things we'll know in advance, some we'll have to figure out as we go.
- You are not only tagging sentences, you're also QA-ing the guidelines themselves. Circular and even contradictory instructions may occur, be mindful about that.
- DO feel free to explore guidelines for other languages for handling interesting phenomena. You can find them all [here][1].
- DO NOT justify your decisions by referring to the [old guidelines][2]. Our guidelines may agree with the old guidelines on several points but they can also differ significantly, even on basic principles and concepts.
- We are all in this together and want this project to be üèÜ. Join the Slack channel, make comments, ask questions. There are no dumb questions.
